This Script is meant to be used to create several system commands that will allow NetOps to troubleshoot connectivity.
The script reads from an excel sheet the IPs that need to be troubleshooted and then writes the output in a txt file.
The excel sheet needs to be in the same directory as the script in order for it to run appropriately.
